            <p>Hello! My name is Joachim Kalangi. Welcome to my personal website where I share information about myself, my hobbies, and my thoughts on various topics.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about art especially in music. I really enjoy listening to music of various genres, whether it's pop, rock, country, and more.
                Currently, I am a bass singer in a choir that I joined, the Sam Ratulangi University Choir, and we have participated in various competitions.
            </p>
            <p>I've been part of the choir communities since high school, and since then, I've frequently participated in competitions, as well as performed in concerts.
                To this day, I remain active in choirs, both at my church and at university (Sam Ratulangi University Choir) and a vocal ensemble I'm currently part of, the Vox Angelica Mix Choir.
            </p>
            <p>This website serves as a platform for me to express my interests and connect with like-minded individuals. Feel free to explore to learn more about me!</p>

                <h3>The journey to A Voyage of Songs</h3>
                <p><small>Posted on 2023, August 5th</small></p>
                <p>To prepare for the competition, we held regular rehearsals three times a week for several months. In the final month before departure, we intensified our training to six sessions per week.
                    On July 19th, we held a Pre-Competition Concert to showcase our progress.
                </p>
                <p>On July 29th, we (Sam Ratulangi University Choir) departed from Manado with a layover in Singapore. The next day, July 30th, we continued our journey to Bangkok, Thailand. Upon arrival, we headed straight to our accommodation and rehearsal a bit then we go to bed.
                    The next day, July 31th, After breakfast, the male singers gathered in the room for sectional rehearsals, and in the afternoon, we continued with full ensemble practice together with the female singers.
                </p>
                <p>On August 1st, the competition events began with participants completing stage testing and a Meet the Jury session, after that we went practice again for tommorow.</p>
                <p>August 2nd was our competition day, beginning in the afternoon. This was the moment we showcased the six songs we had meticulously rehearsed for months across two categories: Mixed Choir and Sacred Music.
                    After competing, we returned to the hotel to prepare for the evening's Friendship Concert, where we performed alongside fellow choirs from Bandung and international groups from the Philippines and China.
                    Upon returning from the concert, we received thrilling news: that we had secured a Grand Prix ticket in the competition, meaning we won one of our entered categories!
                </p>
                <p>August 3rd, after breakfast, we rehearsed to prepare for the Grand Prix, where we would compete against other choirs that had won their respective categories.
                    As evening approached, the event began. Following our performance, the award ceremony commenced, honoring choirs from each category.
                    PSM UNSRAT achieved Champion in both entered categories: Mixed Choir and Sacred Music
                    and Two special awards: 🎵 "Chanson De Voyager" for highest-scored competition piece (Psalm 8 by Dan Forrest) 🎼 "The Best Conductor" for our trainer and maestro, Hermantika Sinapa
                    Then came the crowning moment, the Grand Prix announcement which PSM UNSRAT won five awards in one night! Such as: 
                    Winner of Mixed Choir Category, Winner of Sacred Music Category, "Chanson De Voyager", "The Best Conductor", Grand Prix Champion.
                    After the euphoria, we celebrated with a restaurant treat before returning to the hotel.</p>

                <h3>Exploring Watercolor Techniques</h3>
                <p><small>Posted on April 2, 2023</small></p>
                <p>Watercolor painting is a beautiful and challenging medium that I've recently begun exploring. In this post, I share some techniques I've learned for creating stunning watercolor effects.</p>
                <p>The wet-on-wet technique creates beautiful, soft blends, while dry brush work adds texture and detail. Mastering the balance between water and pigment is key to successful watercolor painting.</p>

                <h3>Why I Love Trail Running</h3>
                <p><small>Posted on March 10, 2023</small></p>
                <p>Trail running combines my love of nature with my passion for fitness. Unlike road running, trail running offers varied terrain and beautiful scenery that makes each run an adventure.</p>
                <p>Beyond the physical benefits, trail running has greatly improved my mental health. There's something incredibly therapeutic about running through forests and mountains that can't be replicated in a gym.</p>
